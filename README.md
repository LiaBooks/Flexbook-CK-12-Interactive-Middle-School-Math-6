# CK-12 Interactive Middle School Math 6

This is what digital education should be! This all-interactive MSM 6 course is a complete and rigorous Grade 6 Mathematics course where the text is the support material, NOT the main content. The course includes instructional interactives, inline immediate-feedback (formative) questions, 'Do you get it?' end-of-lesson quizzes, Adaptive Practice, curated additional Related Modalities, teacher's edition, and more. Furthermore, because it is CK-12, it is completely FREE! Like all CK-12 FlexBooks 2.0, it is a 'living book' and will be regularly updated to take advantage of the best possible content. The CK-12 Interactive Middle School Math series promotes exploratory learning (Stein 2010). Each lesson contains interactive applets which actively engage students in the learning process and allow them to explore concepts in an open-ended environment (Cocea & Magoulas, 2015; Hoyles, 2018; NCTM, 20115). Inline question sets Socratically guide students to discover connections present in the interactive applets.
