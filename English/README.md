# CK-12 Interactive Middle School Math 6

## 1.1 Introducing Ratios

### What's the best way to sort coral?

The image below displays a coral reef. If you sorted the coral by color, how many groups would you have? If you sorted by shapes of coral, how many groups would you have? In this lesson, you will learn to describe two quantities and represent them with pictures.

![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A3d0a1ca59d9f1577f5c79d0df3d9667016892797d93682727d04d43e%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1 "Figure 1")

1. In the picture above, there are 6 pink corals and 1 grey coral. Select the following statement that describes how many grey corals there are, compared to how many pink corals there are.

   - [( )] For the 6 grey corals, there is 1 pink coral.
   - [(X)] For the 1 grey coral, there are 6 pink corals.
   - [( )] There are half as many pink corals as there are grey corals.
   - [( )] There are half as many grey corals as there are pink corals.
  
2. Select the following statement that describes how many pink corals there are in the picture compared to how many giant sharks there are in the picture.

    - [( )] For the 6 pink corals, there are 2 giant sharks.
    - [( )] For the 1 grey coral, there are 6 pink corals.
    - [(X)] For the 6 pink corals, there are no giant sharks.
    - [( )] There are no giants sharks in the picture.

### How do you use ratios in baking?

![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3Ac9986202ec9166ad1f8da420272068b679ee19d10f568de0ab58e47a%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1 "Figure 2: Sugar Cookies")

1. Angie wants to bake cookies for a bake sale. The recipe says, "for every 1 cup of butter use 3 cups of flour."

   What does "for every" mean in the recipe?

   - [(X)] "For every" means the same thing as "for each" or per"
   - [( )] "For every" means the same thing as "always" or "forever"
   - [( )] "For every" means the same thing as "instead of"
   - [( )] None of these answers are correct
   ******************************************
   Great work! For **each** cup of butter Angie will use 3 cups of flour. You could also say that Angie will use 3 cups of flour **per** cup of butter. 
   ******************************************

2. Angie wants to bake cookies for a bake sale. The recipe says, "for every 1 cup of butter use 3 cups of flour."

   You can use the word **ratio** to show the relationship between quantities. What is the ratio of butter to flour in one batch of cookies?

   - [( )] $3:1$
   - [( )] $3-1$
   - [( )] $\frac{2}{3}$
   - [(X)] $1:3$
   ******************************************
   "For every 1 cup of butter use 3 cups of flour" can be expressed as "1 cup of butter to 3 cups of flour" and can be written as the ratio $1:3$.
   ******************************************

3. Jake wants to bake brownies for the bake sale. The recipe says, "for every 9 cups of flour use 4 cups of butter."

   What is the ratio of flour to butter?

   - [( )] $9-4$
   - [( )] $\frac{4}{9}$
   - [( )] $4:9$
   - [( )] $9:4$

4. Jonah wants to bake carrot cake for the bake sale. The recipe says, "for every 3 cups of batter use 2 cups of carrots." What is the ratio of carrots to batter?

   [[2:3]]

5. Does it matter where the phrase "for every" appears in the ratio?

   For example: Do the two statements below mean the same thing?

   "Use 4 cups of butter for every 9 cups of flour"

   "For every 4 cups of butter use 9 cups of flour"

   - [( )] It does matter where the statement "for every" appears in the ratio. The meaning of the statements are different because "for every" is in regards to flour in the first statement. in the second "for every" is in regards to the butter.
   - [( )] It only matters if the "for every" is attached to an amount of 1. For example, "For every cup of butter, use 2 cups of flour" is different than "Use a cup of butter for every 2 cups of flour."
   - [(X)] It doesn't matter where the phrase "for every" appears in the ratio. The statements mean the same thing because the numbers don't change in the ratio.
   ******************************************
   The ratio is 4:9 in both statements. "For every" doesn't change a thing!
   ******************************************

You can use the word **ratio** to show the relationship between quantities. A recipe might say, "for every 5 cups of flour use 3 eggs." So, the ratio of flour to eggs would be 5:3.

### Block Color Ratios

![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3Ae16deac1fbe5754c6a0de1730c6c305ba9aa8e14ed11c5a21d3ec984%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1 "Figure 3: Colored toy blocks")

Make your own groups by sorting the blocks in the interactive below. Think about how you can make ratios with the groups of blocks.

* Sort the shapes by dragging them into the boxes that match their color.
* After you sort the shapes, fill in the blanks to complete the ratio sentences.

</iframe>

1. Sometimes the same situation can involve multiple different kinds of ratios. Just as there are ratios describing the number of each color block, there are other ratios here describing the ratios of the sizes of the blocks themselves.

   What is the ratio of the size of the largest block to the size of the smallest block in the interactive? Choose the TRUE statement.

   - [( )] $1 : 2$; Meaning that the small blocks are two times smaller than the large blocks.
   - [( )] $3 : 1$; Meaning that the large blocks are three times as big as the small blocks.
   - [( )] $2 : 1$; Meaning that the small blocks are twice as big as the large blocks.
   - [(X)] $2 : 1$; Meaning that the large blocks are twice as big as the small blocks.
   - [[?]] To compare sizes of blocks, use the grid in the background of the interactive to count the number of squares that make up each block.
   ************************************************
   You got it! If you count the number of squares that make up the largest block, you can see there are 4. If you count the squares that make up the small block, you should get 2. You know that 4 is 2 doubled, so 2 small blocks make up a large block!

   ---

   Use the background grid to count the number of squares that make up each block.

   The number of squares that make up the largest block = 4.

   The number of squares that make up the smallest block = 2.

   4 is 2 doubled, meaning that 2 small blocks make up a large block!

   **The large blocks are twice as big as the small blocks and the ratio of the size of a large block to the size of a small block is 2 : 1.**
   ************************************************

2. Suppose there were 3 red, 2 blue, and 3 green blocks. The ratio of red blocks to blue blocks would be $3 : 2$.

   What other comparison could this ratio represent?

   - [( )] The ratio of red to green.
   - [( )] The ratio of blue to red.
   - [(X)] The ratio of green to blue.
   ************************************************
   Another way to represent $3 : 2$ is by using the green blocks and the blue blocks! Since there are 3 green blocks and 2 blue blocks, the ratio of green to blue would also be $3 : 2$!
   ************************************************

3. If the ratio of blue blocks to red blocks is 5 : 7, what is the ratio of red blocks to blue blocks?

   [[7:5]]
   ************************************************
   The order of the numbers in the ratio is important! For the ratio of red to blue needs to be the number of red : the number of blue. Order matters!

   If the ratio of blue blocks to red blocks is 5 : 7, the ratio of red blocks to blue blocks is 7 : 5. You could also say it is 7 to 5.
   ************************************************

### **Pancakes**

You can think about how sorting and ratios relate to division while using this PLIX.

**Example**

![](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A43d581782dcef2ff7f6c0615ac7c989b05f96b3252e62e663f81c698%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1 "Figure 4: Monarch Butterfly showing four wings")

Every butterfly has four wings. The relationship between butterflies and wings can be described as:

- Four wings for every butterfly.
- For every four wings there is one butterfly.
- Four wings `per` butterfly.
- One butterfly per four wings.
- The ratio of wings to butterflies is 4:1.
- The ratio of wings to butterflies is 4 to 1.
- Each butterfly has four wings.
- Every four wings equal one butterfly.
- The ratio of butterflies to wings is 1:4.
- The ratio of butterflies to wings is 1 to 4.

> __Remember This!__
>
> - A **ratio** is the relationship between two or more quantities.
> - Words such as, "for every", "for each", and "per" are used to describe ratios.

### **Review Questions**

Would you rather sort the corals by color or by shape? Explain your reasoning.

Some people argue that the ratio of ingredients in a recipe doesn't matter as long as you have the right total `amount`. Do you agree or disagree? Explain your reasoning.

True or False: If the ratio of red blocks to blue blocks is 2:3, this means there are more red blocks than blue blocks. Explain your answer.

Predict what would happen to the number of wings if the number of butterflies increased by 5.

![I voted sticker](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A417ef2781cf4489ac9959604694f9069fc0cad8542c34073a108986d%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1 "Figure 1: The 'I Voted' sticker people get after they vote!")

1. A reporter might say:

   "Coolidge received about two votes _per_ vote for Davis."

   What does the word 'per' mean in this situation?

   Replace "per" with a different two-word phrase for the sentence below without changing the meaning.

   1. Coolidge received about two votes [[for]] [[each]] vote for Davis.
      [[?]] What other phrases mean the same thing as "per?"
      *****************************************************
      The terms "for each" and "for every" mean the same thing as "per" when used to describe a ratio.
      *****************************************************

2. The ratio of the votes in the 1924 presidential election was approximately 2 votes for Coolidge for each 1 vote for Davis.

   The blue boxes represent votes for Coolidge, and the green boxes represent votes for Davis.

   Sort the images by dragging the associated letter into the correct bins below.

   Todo

3. Calvin Coolidge won the United States presidential election in 1924 against his rival John W. Davis. For every vote Davis received, Coolidge received nearly two votes.

   Which statements below correctly describe the ratio of the election results?

   Select all that apply

   - [[X]] The vote ratio of Coolidge to Davis is 2 : 1
   - [[X]] The ratio of Coolidge to Davis votes was nearly two to one.
   - [[ ]] For each Coolidge vote, there was a Davis vote.
   - [[ ]] The ratio was about one Coolidge vote per Davis vote.
   - [[X]] For every Davis vote, there were about two Coolidge votes.
   - [[X]] The ratio of Davis to Coolidge votes was about one to two.

If you are curious, here are the actual results from the 1924 presidential election:

| Candidate            | Popular Votes |
| -------------------- | ------------: |
| Calvin Coolidge      |      15725016 |
| John W. Davis        |       8386503 |
| Robert M. LaFollette |       4822856 |


### Tape Diagrams

For the next interactive, you will practice reading tape diagrams that represent ratios.

Type in the whole numbers that correctly represent the visual ratio you see here.

### How many miles can a car go on a tank full of gasoline? 

It is good to know how many miles your car can travel on a full tank of gasoline. Use the interactive to explore how you could write ratios between miles and gallons and how this ratio could change depending on the number of miles traveled and gallons of gas consumed.

* Enter the number of miles and gallons for each truck.
* Click the buttons for different trucks.

<iframe src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/q7ue39aa/xfbZFIuRIB7tNGfi/width/500/height/500" 
  width="500"
  height="500"
  style="border:0px;"
  allowfullscreen></iframe>

Use the interactive to illustrate the ratios, then drag each ratio description to the bin labeled with the matching sentence from the interactive.

80 miles per 15 gallons 5 gallons to 300 miles 200 miles for every 10 gallons

300 miles to 5 gallons 10 gallons for every 200 miles 15 gallons per 80 miles

"This truck can drive 80 miles on 15 gallons of gas"

"This truck can drive 300 miles on 5 gallons of gas"

"This truck can drive 200 miles on 10 gallons of gas"

### Mixing Paint Colors

Red, blue, and yellow are called primary colors. Orange, purple, and green are called secondary colors, and are each created by combining two primary colors:

* Red and yellow together create orange
* Red and blue together create purple
* Blue and Yellow together create green

Through the interactive below, experiment with creating different colors by mixing different ratios of red, yellow and blue paint. Try to make brown paint by using a ratio of 3 cups of yellow paint to 4 cups of red paint to 5 cups of blue paint.

* Click on the colors to pour the paint into the cup.
* You can mix 12 colors.

</iframe>

1. Use the interactive to make brown paint using a mixture of yellow, red and blue paints. You can do this by using 3 red, 2 yellow and 2 blue. Choose the correct statement below that describes the ratios of the paint colors.

   The ratio of yellow cups to red cups to blue cups is 3:2:2.

   The ratio of yellow cups to red cups to blue cups is 2:3:2.

   The ratio of yellow cups to red cups to blue cups is 2:2:3.

**Discussion Questions**

1. How can you use a ratio to describe the numbers of cups of paint it takes to make this shade of brown paint?
2. You can make different shades of brown by mixing different ratios of red, blue, and yellow. Use the interactive to draw a picture to show the ratio for a different shade of brown.
3. How can you describe the shade of brown you created as a ratio between a primary color (red, blue, or yellow) and a complementary color (green, purple, or orange)?

> ### Remember this!
>
> * A **ratio** is the relationship between two or more quantities.
> * Words such as, "for every", "for each", and "per" are used to describe ratios.
> * Some examples of ratios written numerically: 3:4, 2:1, 1:3:1

### **Review Questions**

Look at this student's work: they have 8 green blocks and 4 yellow blocks and they say the ratio of yellow blocks to green blocks is 8:4. Where did they make a mistake?

Would you rather have a 2:1 ratio of votes in your favor or a 3:2 ratio of votes in your favor? Explain your reasoning.

True or False: If a tape diagram is divided into 8 sections with 5 sections shaded and 3 not shaded, the ratio it represents is 5:3. Explain your answer.

Predict what would happen to the ratio of miles to gallons if a car could travel further on the same amount of gasoline.

Predict what would happen to the shade of brown if you changed the ratio of yellow paint to 2 cups, but kept the amounts of red and blue paint the same.
